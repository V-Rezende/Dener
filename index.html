            Dener Augusto de Sousa (São Paulo, April 2, 1971 — Rio de Janeiro,
            April 19, 1994) was a forward midfield Brazilian soccer player. A classic number 10. 
          </p>
          <p>
            An extremely fast and skilful player, he was considered one of the
            most promising of his generation but died prematurely, 17 days after
            turning 23, in a car accident. He is also considered the last great
            star in the history of Portuguesa, a Football Team in Brazil.

                    <p>Dener grew up in the Vila Ede neighbourhood of São Paulo. Despite facing challenges such as losing his father at a young age, he worked to support his family while studying in the morning and playing indoor football for money in the evenings, achieving success in intercollegiate tournaments.</p>
                    <p>In 1987, Dener was briefly detained along with others but was released after signing an agreement with the director of his school, Bilac School. This agreement allowed him to participate in a supervised release program, demonstrating his potential to overcome adversity.</p>

                        <p>Dener had a tough beginning in football, briefly played for São Paulo, but eventually turned pro with Portuguesa. At 11, he debuted at Canindé Stadium for Portuguesa's youth team.</p>
                        
                        <p>In 1988, on the youth teams, Coach José Wilson, in charge of the senior team brougth him up to the pros. For three years, Dener trained with the pros and still played for the juniors. During this time, he led Portuguesa to their first Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior title in 1991, earning the tournament's best player award.</p>
                        
                        <p>Dener's debut as a pro was on October 1989, in a 2-1 loss to Grêmio in Porto Alegre.</p>
                      
                        <p>In 1991, he scored the Canindé Stadium's best-ever goal. Playing in a Campeonato Paulista match against Inter de Limeira, Dener skillfully weaved past three opponents and over rough field patches. The ball went haywire but ended up in the net, leaving the goalkeeper stunned.</p>

                <p>Dener grabbed Grêmio's attention in the Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior final when they lost 4-0 to Portuguesa. Zelio Hocsman, the ex-assistant to president Fábio Koff, remembers how that "little guy" left a lasting impression by "destroying" Grêmio in the Copa São Paulo final at the Olímpico Stadium.</p>
                <p>In 1993, Dener was loaned to the Gaúcho club for three months, winning the 1993 Gaúcho Championship and earning his first pro title.</p>

            <p>After the loan spell with the Gremio, he returned to Portuguesa to compete in the 1993 Campeonato Brasileiro, helping the team secure a ninth-place finish.</p>
            <p>During his return to Portuguesa, a game against Santos stood out, where Dener scored a fantastic goal: he passed the ball between the legs of defender Índio, outpaced another opponent with his speed, dribbled past goalkeeper Edinho, and slotted the ball into the net.</p>
            <p>In total, across his two spells with the club, he played 141 matches and scored 24 goals while wearing the Lusa jersey.</p>

            <p>In the following year, 1994, Dener was loaned again, this time to Vasco da Gama, where he delivered impressive performances and won the Taça Guanabara.</p>
            <p>During a Vasco excursion to Argentina, he shone in a friendly match against Newell's Old Boys and received praise from even Maradona, who made it a point to congratulate him after the game.</p>
            <p>Vasco fans chanted "Dener is a mix of Garrincha and Pelé."</p>
            <p>On April 17, 1994, he played his last match: a 1-1 draw with Fluminense in the final quadrangular of the Campeonato Carioca. Dener was sent off in that game and drove to São Paulo in his free time.</p>
            <p>The player would tragically pass away two days after this match, before he could celebrate Vasco's third consecutive Carioca championship.</p>

            <p>At the young age of twenty and still playing for Portuguesa, Dener had his first opportunity with the Brazilian National Team. On March 27, 1991, in Buenos Aires, he made his debut against Argentina, coming on as a substitute for midfielder Luís Henrique. Even with limited time on the field, the diminutive player from Portuguesa initiated the play that led to Brazil's third goal.</p>
            <p>He was part of the Brazilian National Team squad that did not qualify for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.</p>

                <p>During his time in Rio de Janeiro, Dener suffered a serious accident that claimed his life. He was returning from São Paulo, where he had met with officials from Portuguesa and Stuttgart, Germany (where Dunga was playing at the time), regarding a potential transfer, and had spent the weekend with his family.</p>
                <p>In the early morning of April 19, his car, driven by his friend Otto Gomes, lost control and collided with a tree at Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, near the Clube Naval Piraquê, on a gentle curve, on Avenida Borges de Medeiros. Months after the accident, a police report confirmed that Otto had fallen asleep at the wheel, causing the crash.</p>
                <p>Dener, who was traveling asleep in the passenger seat, was asphyxiated by the seatbelt and also hit his head on the car's roof, according to the investigation, which concluded that the car was in fifth gear and traveling at high speed. The cause of Dener's death was asphyxia due to laryngeal injury and neck contusion.</p>
                <p>This accident tragically ended a promising career. Subsequent investigations revealed that Dener had reclined the seat too far, nullifying the effectiveness of the seatbelt.</p>
